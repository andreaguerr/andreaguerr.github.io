# Upcoming Events

## From First Principles to Future Colliders: Amplitudes, Bootstraps, and Energy Correlators  
*Co-Organizer*  
**Aspen Center for Physics**, 12 July – 2 August 2026  
[Program webpage](https://aspenphys.org/summer-workshops/#event6140).  
A 3-week Aspen summer program bringing together researchers in amplitudes, the S-matrix bootstrap, non-perturbative QFT, and collider physics. Focus on first-principles approaches to LHC observables and future collider physics.


## Bootstrap 2026
