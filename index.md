## About  
I am a theoretical physicist working at the interface of scattering amplitudes, the S-matrix bootstrap, and non-perturbative quantum field theory methods. My research combines first-principles constraints with modern optimization techniques to explore strongly interacting systems, collider observables, and quantum gravity.  
*Quantum fields and strings, scattering amplitudes, S-matrix Bootstrap, non-perturbative physics.*

## Research

My work is the expression of my mixed interest in particle physics phenomenology, mathematics, and numerical methods for strongly interacting systems. Here is a short list of topics I have covered in my latest works.

- S-matrix Bootstrap and non-perturbative constraints on QFT observables  
- Applications to QCD, hadron spectroscopy, and collider physics  
- Constraints on quantum gravity and UV completions of the Standard Model
- Montecarlo for matrix models

## Open Questions & Notes

A (very incomplete) list of directions I find exciting today:

- Bootstrap applications to QCD
- Non-perturbative bounds on total cross sections for fermions  
- Bootstrap Quantum Mechanics and Matrix Models 
- Constraints on higher-derivative corrections to supergravity $D^4 R^4, D^6 R^4,\dots$ from unitarity
