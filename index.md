## Research

My work lies at the interface of scattering amplitudes, optimization, phenomenology, and non-perturbative methods for strongly interacting systems.

- S-matrix Bootstrap and non-perturbative constraints on QFT observables  
- Applications to QCD, hadron spectroscopy, and collider physics  
- Constraints on quantum gravity and UV completions of the Standard Model
- Montecarlo for matrix models

## Open Questions & Notes

A (very incomplete) list of directions I find exciting:

- Non-perturbative bounds on total cross sections for fermions  
- Predict more exotic states  
- Constraints on higher-derivative corrections $D^4 R^4, D^6 R^4,\dots$ from unitarity
